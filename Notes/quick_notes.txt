### 3/12/2024
Prior to Meeting/Talking Points:
<ol>
<li> Farhadifar_Model notebook
<li> Discuss the importance of boundary conditions
<li> Discuss forces on larger tissues and compare to my hand calculated values
<li> Expectation for force values using half edge structure on boundary
<li> "is_active" parameters in model spec dictionary could help define boundary conditions
</ol>

Minutes
<ol>
<li> Need to find boundary conditions that the model uses, perhaps use periodic boundary condition
<li> Send Alyssa yml file
<li> Gradient descent is stepping in the opposite direction to the gradient, to approach a minimum
<li> For substrate friction method, /eta /dv{x}{t} = - \nabla E = F
<li. Consider which method to use
<li> Differentiate energy function to have an attempt prepared for the next meeting
<li> Get started in a Latex document, begin outlining report
<li> Discuss Gen AI on Thursday
</ol>
