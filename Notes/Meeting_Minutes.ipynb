    "    <li> Read Farhadifar et al. 2007 in detail and study the model and their main results.\n",
    "    <li> Start experimenting with Tyssue and run some simple tutorials.\n",
    "    <li> In some time reproduce Farhadifar's results, i.e. generating a tissue, allowing for cell divisions to get a disordered tissue, reproducing Lewis' law.\n",
    "    <li> Meet twice a week at least for the starting period. The current plan is 10 am on Tuesdays and 2 pm on Thursdays.\n",
